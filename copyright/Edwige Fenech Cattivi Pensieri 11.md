She won the title of "Miss Mannequin de la Cote d'Azur" at age 16 and even participated in a Miss France contest. [^1^]
 
She made her film debut in 1967 with the French comedy Toutes folles de lui (All Crazy About Him), directed by Norbert Carbonnaux.

Fenech became famous for her roles in two genres of Italian cinema: commedia sexy all'italiana and giallo. The former was a type of comedy that featured erotic situations and innuendos, often involving stereotypical professions such as teachers, soldiers, policewomen and nurses.

Fenech excelled in both genres, displaying her comedic timing, dramatic skills and sensual appeal. [^2^]
 
Some of her most notable films in these genres are Ubalda, All Naked and Warm (1972), Giovannona Long-Thigh (1973), The School Teacher (1975), The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh (1971), All the Colors of the Dark (1972), Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key (1972) and The Case of the Bloody Iris (1972).

In the 1980s, Fenech reduced her film appearances and focused on television work.

In 2007, she made a comeback to acting with a cameo role in Hostel: Part II , directed by Eli Roth , who is a fan of her giallo films. She played an art class professor who poses nude for her students. Roth said that he wrote the part specifically for her and that he was honored to work with her. Quentin Tarantino , another fan of her films, named a character after her in his film Inglourious Basterds (2009) and invited her to the Italian premiere.
